### Description

I decided to make a winsock app to help "newbies"(No offense to anyone) understand winsock and how it connects, send's data, recieves, etc. A chat program would be a perfect example, but there are so many chat examples out already. In this chat, all the messages are recieved in MsgBox's. It's a bit original, if this code doesn't help you fully understand how winsock works, it will help you to some extent if you have no idea what your doing.
